Mozilla DeepSpeech
========
DeepSpeech is an open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on [Baidu's Deep Speech research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567). Project DeepSpeech uses Google's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to make the implementation easier.
